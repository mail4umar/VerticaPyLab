Video Recording

## Introduction

This document covers the basics of video recording and editing to create content for the VerticaPy Lesson Series.

## What will you need?

A ring-light along with VerticaPy shirt will be mailed to you. You will also need a basic video editing software like windows movie maker on your computer.

## Recording

To record a video:

Environment

- Please select a suitable place with a plain color (preferably light colors) background.
- Make sure there are no clutters or anything else in the background that can distract the viewers.
- Make sure the light is sufficient. Best to record yourself during the day when you have some natural light. Position yourself against a window to allow maximum light. Note: You can even use your built-in mobile phone editing software to enhance some colors or adjust lighting if you do not have ideal conditions.

Camera position

- Keep the camera at your eye-level that you will use for recording.
- Make sure that the camera is in a horizontal position.
- Keep the camera around an arm's length from you.
- Try not to leave too much space above your head in the frame.
- Try to look directly into the camera lens.

## Presentation Recording

If you want to share some presentation slides to help understand some complex concepts then you can use Microsoft Power Point to record video along with your narration. Just follow along the steps here:

## Screen Recording

You can also easily use Microsoft Power Point to record your screen if you want to share something other than just plain power point. The instruction are straight forward and nicely summarized here:

## Joining Videos

If you end up creating multiple videos, then first you will need to patch them all together in the right sequence. For example, if you recorded one video of yourself, then had another power point presentation recording, then you will need to join them together. To achieve this, you will need a simple video editing tool like Windows Movie Maker or OpenShot Video Editor.

Since you will have recorded those videos in multiple backgrounds and environments, it is possible that your audio has different sound levels. To mitigate this, you need to normalize the sound and get rid of background noise. You can do this if your video editing tool has that capability, or you could do it using audacity as explained in a separate README (READ ME â€“ Audio Editing.docx). If you edit the audio using audacity, then you will have to follow these steps:

1. Patch the videos together in the desired sequence using a video editing tool.
2. Export the video as an MP4 file.
3. Use audacity to separate the audio and remove noise/normalize.
4. Export audio as MP3 file.
5. Open the video (MP4 file) in the video editing software and remove the audio from it. Replace the audio with the exported MP3 file.
6. Export the video as an MP4 file again. This is your final video.

If you do not use audacity, then simply adjust the audio and export the video as an MP4 file.
