# VerticaPy-Enablement-Template
This repo has jupyter notebook templates that can be used to create lessons to teach basic data science concepts to the general audience. The idea is to have a unified layout so that it looks professional, and it is easy to modify before making it online.
The end-goal of these lessons is to enable and attract users to VerticaPy. <br>
 Read the "READ ME - VerticaPy Lesson Series.docs" for more information on how to use these templates.<br>
 Read the "READ ME - Audio editing" to learn how to edit the audio of the videos for any lesson.
